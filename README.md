# FontMaker iPad (Static)

Statisk webapp (HTML/CSS/JS) for iPad + Apple Pencil to draw glyphs and export an OTF font.

## Run

- Open `/Users/baltax/Documents/apps/fontmaker-ipad/index.html` directly in Safari (works as `file://`).
- If you want to host it as static files, serve the folder with any static server (no backend required).

## Export requirements (MVP)

Export is blocked until these are filled (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, ÅÄÖ, åäö).

Optional included in the font: space + `.,!?-()`.
